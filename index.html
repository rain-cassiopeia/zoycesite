            To my best friend.
<br><br>
12.31.2025
<br><br>
My life has taken on such a new shape these days. The I spend in different states of mind is so changed. So I learn to introspect in new ways, and continue to learn. 
<br><br>
It is cold these days. The wind blows me backwards when I bike to work; my puffer coat is like a sail, turning the journey up lancaster into a sisyphean ordeal. But on the trip back I don’t even need to pedal. I put my hands in my pockets and coast southeast, watching the world go by as the wind pulls me home. 
<br><br>
You have a lot of time to think when you don’t have to pedal or steer. 
<br><br>
I want to write to you about care. It’s a word I’ve come to while thinking about friendship. Or companionship. I was considering how it could be that we might love the time spent with someone, be deeply, overwhelmingly happy around someone, and yet feel an emptiness with them. A disconnection. That we might not trust them in an apocalypse. What is the nature of friendship, that we could spend every day happily in the company of someone who we could not confess our fears to? Can I identify the thing that is missing?
<br><br>
For all of my condemnation of the obligation of family, I believe family is a good place to start. Generally speaking, family is a thing that can be relied upon. They help you when you are in need. Their idea of your best interest might not align with your own, and the world is not free of shitty family members, but I believe this holds in the general case. I want to describe this as care. 
<br><br>
I believe this can also be found in some romantic partnerships. What I had with Fiona, and what I have with Danny. What you had with Ryosei, from what I know. It’s something permanent. Even if you haven’t spoken in years, they would help you if you were in need. This is care.
<br><br>
I think this is incredibly rare among friends. And I admit it’s a bit fallacious to paint this as a binary—kind people help each other, and people care about their friends. But I want to describe something different. What I’m calling “care” is a kind of trust. Maybe it’s love. It’s how we rely on people. When I feel cared for, I feel able to ask for help. Able to be vulnerable. 
<br><br>
You don’t have to get along incredibly well with someone to have care for them. Family disagreements commonly range from the ideological to the financial, and yet we care for our family. I think you can be less than best friends with someone and still care for them, or be cared for by them.
<br><br>
But what a gift it is to have both. 
<br><br>
There is no one I can talk to more freely than you. No one who I feel understands me as immediately, willingly, and without judgement.
